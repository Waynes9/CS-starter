# Basic knowledge of JAVA
* public class *classname* { }
* End lines with semicolon
* Typically we want to run our main method inside *public static void main(String[] args){}*
* Types are verified before the code was run
* Expression has a type
# Declaring Functions
* A function that is part of a class is called method. So in Java, every function is a method
* All parameters of a function must have clear type, and the return value of a function must have a clear type
* Functions in Java return only one value
